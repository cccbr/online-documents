<a class=anchor href=#introduction>#</a></h1><p>For those who are not familiar with the use of online documents such as these, this chapter introduces the concept of a &lsquo;Static Site Generator&rsquo; and gives a broad view of how it is used.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-static-site-generator>What is a ‘Static Site Generator’?
<a class=anchor href=#what-is-a-static-site-generator>#</a></h2><p>The document you are reading now is stored on a server. It has been delivered over the internet to a browser (Safari, Chrome or Firefox, for example) on your device, which may be a desktop PC (for the older readers), laptop, tablet or phone, for you to read. That is ‘read’ in the widest sense – It could include pictures, sound or video. The important point is that the information you see is what is stored on the server and can only be changed by altering the files on the server. That explains the word ‘Static’. This allows for fast download of content and is ideal for an electronic book like this.</p><blockquote class="book-hint warning">Many websites allow interaction – selecting a purchase from an online catalogue, for example. These are ‘Dynamic’ websites but we are not going there. In many cases the static/dynamic distinction may be blurred, anyway.</blockquote><p>At the most basic level, the content of a web page is written in a markup language called html (hypertext markup language) which includes tags defining the appearance – paragraphs, headings and so on. You could write a website directly in html but people want something more exciting, with various colour schemes and layouts. Without going into detail, this involves extending the basic html to include features such as stylesheets and even code such as JavaScript. This allows features such as navigation menus and a layout that changes depending on the width of your browser screen.</p><p>All of this makes life difficult for anyone who just wants a nice-looking web page. So, several very clever people have produced programs which take basic text and transform it into a static web page. These are called ‘Static Site Generators’ – Jekyll is one example and Hugo is another. Taking it a step further, the design of the site generator allows other clever people to add different ‘themes’, giving you a wide choice of the appearance of your final website.</p><p>This document, like the other CCCBR online documents, uses the Hugo ‘Book’ theme produced by Alex Shpak. It is somewhat austere, without gimmicks, but seems appropriate for our documents. The basic text for a Hugo document is written in a scripting language called Markdown, which will be described <a href=../020-markdown>later</a>. I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself - hyperlinks are shown in blue (not underlined). But we will come to those.</p><h2 id=how-do-you-use-hugo>How do you use Hugo?
<a class=anchor href=#how-do-you-use-hugo>#</a></h2><p>If you have opened this using a desktop, laptop or tablet in landscape mode (essentially with a wide screen) you will see the text in the centre of the screen, with navigation menus on left and right sides. The left hand menu navigates to the main sub-divisions of the document. We will see later that these are actually separate web pages but we will call them ‘chapters’ to maintain the concept of a ‘book’. The right hand menu navigates to the sections and sub-sections of the current chapter and will change depending which chapter you are reading.</p><p>If you are reading this on a device with a narrower screen (a tablet in portrait mode or a phone), there is no room for the menus. Instead, you will see menu bars (three stacked horizontal lines) at top left and top right. Clicking one of these takes you to the appropriate chapter or section; clicking again removes the menu.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">You can simulate this on a desktop or laptop by reducing the width of the browser window.</blockquote><blockquote class="book-hint warning">A convenient way to use a tablet (such as an iPad) is to hold it horizontally and use the navigation menus to locate the chapter of interest, then turn it vertical to read the text, which will fill the screen.</blockquote><p>The presence of these navigation menus removes the need for a conventional contents list and you will later that the use of hyperlinks allows you to move between chapters and sections without the need for text such as “see Chapter 5”. Neither do we need to say things like “see page 73” because there is no pagination as in a conventional book – you just scroll through each chapter.</p><h2 id=disclaimer>Disclaimer
