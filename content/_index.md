# Online Documents

## Introduction

The Stewardship & Management Workgroup have produced three online documents:
 - **[Belfry Upkeep](https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/)**, aimed
    at the Steeple Keeper - the one responsible for keeping the bells
    in order.
 - **[Belfry Projects](https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/)**,
    offering advice to anyone who is considering a project to install
    bells or undertake restoration work on a bell installation in a bell
    tower.
 - **[Running a Tower](https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/)**, 
    aimed at the Tower Captain - the person with overall responsibility
    for looking after all aspects of a tower.

During this work, experience has been gained in several areas:
 - Exploiting the advantages of an online format.
 - Overcoming some limitations.
 - A writing style appropriate to the format.
 - The technical steps needed to produce a document.
 - The workflow in moving from a first draft to the final document.
 - The maintenance of published documents.

This experience currently rests in a limited number of individuals and this document is intended as a Manual for the production of online documents, intended to share the experience more widely. We expect regular updates to this document, as experience widens and possible additinal features are included.
