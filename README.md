# Online Documents

This document records experience gained during the production of the CCCBR Stewardship & Management Workgroup online documents (*Belfry Upkeep*, *Running a Tower* and *Belfry Projects*) using the Hugo static site generator. It is intended to be a 'living document' to be developed further as more experience is gained. In particular, it will be available to others taking over the maintenance and development of the documents in the future.
